# Cyber-Bot



Cyber Bot doesn't only answer your questions but it also has several functions:

you can play videos on YouTube by simply typing/telling the robot: play something (for example play bohemian rhapsody) and it will play the first clip that it finds on YouTube.

you can google whatever you want by typing/telling the robot: google something (for example google cyber security) and it will turn on your default web browser and google it for you.

you can open web pages by typing/telling the robot: open something.com (for example open facebook.com or open msecurity.org) and it will turn on your default web browser and open the web page for you.

you can take a picture and it will be saved under the name "pic.jpg" in Cyber Bot's folder and you can do it by typing/telling the robot: either camera or take a picture or picture.


<b>install requires libraries such as: gtts, speech_recognition, mutagen.mp3, re, urllib, opencv-python and wikipedia.</b>
